This repository contains Python implementations of **Contour Tracking** and **Hough Transform Tracking** algorithms, designed to control an RC car using a Raspberry Pi. The goal is to compare the performance of these two techniques in detecting and following paths or obstacles in real-time environments .


## üìå Overview

The project focuses on implementing two popular computer vision techniques‚Äî**Contour Detection** and **Hough Transform**‚Äîto enable an RC car to detect and follow paths or lanes autonomously. The Raspberry Pi acts as the brain of the system, processing video input and controlling the car's motors accordingly.

- **Contour Detection**: Detects shapes and boundaries in the environment by identifying edges and grouping them into contours.
- **Hough Transform**: Detects straight lines in the environment, which can be used for lane detection or obstacle avoidance .

Both methods are compared in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness in dynamic environments.

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time object/line detection using OpenCV.
- Control of an RC car via GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.
- Modular codebase with separate implementations for contour tracking (`contour.py`) and Hough transform tracking (`hough_transform.py`).
- Easy-to-follow setup instructions for replicating the experiment.

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8 or higher.
   - OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`).
   - NumPy (`pip install numpy`).

3. **Optional**:
   - Bluetooth module for smartphone control .

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Champion2049/IEE_RC.git
   cd IEE_RC
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Connect your hardware:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Running Contour Tracking
To run the contour-based tracking algorithm:
```bash
python contour.py
```

### Running Hough Transform Tracking
To run the Hough transform-based tracking algorithm:
```bash
python hough_transform.py
```

### Controls
- The RC car will start moving automatically when the script is executed.
- Use keyboard inputs (if implemented) or modify the code to customize behavior.

## üìä Results

- **Contour Tracking**: Effective for detecting irregular shapes but may struggle with noisy environments.
- **Hough Transform**: Ideal for detecting straight lines and works well in structured environments like roads .
